# OhBoyBot

---

#### Oh Boy, is this a bad Discord bot...
#### How good I can now share this piece of dirty code to the public!

---

- The `main.py` file is the actual Python 3 executable file of the bot.
- The `badjokes` file contains some very bad jokes that the bot can send on demand.
- The `Help.pdf` file is related to all the bots most important commands on a friends Discord server.

Make sure to *[register](https://discord.com/developers)* your own Bot and to change line **34** of `main.py` accordingly.
You are free to modify this bot and do pretty much what ever you want. See `![LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)` for detailed license information.
