# OhBoyBot

### Oh Boy, is this a bad Discord bot...
#### How good I can now share this piece of dirty code to the public!

---

- The `main.py` file is the actual python executable file of the bot.
- The `badjokes` file contains some very bad jokes that the bot can send on demand.
- The `Help.pdf` file is related to all the bots most important commands on a friends Discord server.
